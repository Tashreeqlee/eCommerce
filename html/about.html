        <h2><strong>About Us</strong></h2>
        <p><strong>Matrix Performance Tuning founded by Tashreeq Lee started as a childhood dream for him where all he knew was cars. His journey started all the way in Cape Town where street racing and car culture are very special. The dream started by Tashreeq Lee, was then turned to reality in 2020 which was the peak year of Covid. He decided to put his mind to work and started tuning his friends cars using his software and coding skills which then led to his friends recommending their friends and since then he has been doing it regularly and have now included full performance exhausts into his service.</strong></p>
